![CI](https://github.com/Ganga4060/sandbox-test/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

This repository includes a minimal GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) that runs on push, pull requests, and manual dispatch. It performs a basic smoke check across Linux, Windows, and macOS runners and lists the files in the repository.

To trigger it immediately, push a commit or use the "Run workflow" button in the Actions tab on GitHub.
